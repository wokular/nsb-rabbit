Notes for the sim client

- worry about message state stuff later
- NodeClient vs AppClient
- Work on a node client where several AppClient (becoming NodeClient) objects are split up and independent.
They send to one TX (sim consumes from it) queue where the messages are pulled off, sent through sim, and goes to producer callback.
Producer callback sends to exchange which routes to the correct queue (each node client gets its own RX queue and consumes from it).
Node client consumes message and then receive() calls the callback passed in by NodeClient during the init

- Look into connections vs channels in terms of multiple unique nodeclients
