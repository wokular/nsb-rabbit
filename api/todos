1) Clean up async code
1a) Check how threading with ioloop affects performance/function
2) Implement push model for client getting messages
3) Implement sim clients (use https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/AMQP-CPP)
4) Modify/check AppClient to support multiple srcips/dstips using one appclient
5) Remove old code
6) Polish documentation
7) Look into BlockingConnection instead of async callbacks? Blocking would require setup and declaration of queues, etc first before running code like send/recv
8) ?? Make sure that server can receive message with either client-specific ID or server-assigned ID of message
